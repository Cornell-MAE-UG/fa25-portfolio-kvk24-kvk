As part of a class project, I was asked to design a toggle-type actuator mechanism within a 150 cm × 50 cm design space, using given actuator specifications. I first chose ground pin locations and a rod length to create the mechanism layout. Then, I calculated the actuator length, stroke, and angles formed by the linkage. Using force balance equations with the actuator’s maximum load, I determined the pickup load to be about 51.15 kN. Finally, I found that the maximum pickup height was limited to 217.4 mm, with smaller strokes giving proportionally smaller loads and heights


This is how I solved the problem - refer to full PDF for the solution.
