This assignment requires selecting a real-world device or system related to course material and explaining in detail how it operates. The system must be described qualitatively, supported with photos or schematics, and accompanied by a system diagram showing heat, work, and any relevant mass flows. The thermodynamic principles covered in the course must be applied by including mass, energy, and entropy balance equations that capture the key physics of the device. In addition, a change in the device design or operating conditions should be proposed, followed by a discussion of how that modification would affect performance. The purpose of this assignment is to connect course concepts to real engineering applications and demonstrate the ability to analyze a system and predict how modifications influence efficiency or overall behavior.

In addition, the device analyzed is a specific, real system rather than a generic type of component or cycle. The analysis identifies a particular model and uses actual numerical values for temperatures, pressures, mass flow rates, or efficiencies obtained from datasheets and technical literature. The thermodynamic equations used in the course are directly combined with these real parameters to demonstrate how the governing relations apply to the chosen system. All assumptions are explicitly stated, and calculations are presented clearly to show the connection between theory and the physical device. Figures, diagrams, and equations are clearly labeled and embedded directly into the site with consistent formatting and readable sizing.
