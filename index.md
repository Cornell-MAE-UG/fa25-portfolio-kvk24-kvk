## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Katherine Krishtopa, and I am sophemore at Cornell Univeristy. I am currently studying mechanical engineering with an economics minor. I have conducted three years of research at NJIT focused on the sonochemical degradation of PFAS contaminants, contributing to a $2M Air Force–funded project. At Cornell, I am a member of AguaClara Cornell, where I help design and prototype sustainable water treatment technologies for communities in Honduras. Alongside my technical work, I serve as the Engineering Representative on Cornell’s Student Assembly, representing over 4,000 undergraduates and collaborating on finance and policy initiatives. These experiences reflect my commitment to applying engineering knowledge to both real-world problem solving and community impact.
